# Gang of 00100
Project Team 4: Election Results Analysis

# Project Brief
Election results are driven by the electoral college every four years, but what if they weren’t?  What if they were driven by district votes instead? Group 4 aims to visualize how the outcomes of our elections may have changed, should winning candidates be determined on the district vote instead of the electoral college.

The Gang of 00100 will visualize the United States map broken down by congressional districts, each of which show voting results, per party, for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 elections.  From there, the team expects to highlight the difference between the actual election results in a defined year, vs whether the outcome would be different if district votes won all.

# Sourced Data
1.	Election Data: Harvard Dataverse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=5028532&version=1.1)
2.	Census Data: [data uploaded to OneDrive: Project 3]

# Data Analysis
1. Narrowed scope to elections post 1952 since the quality of the vote data, by district (including county split), isn’t as limited.
2. Scope of years was further narrowed when it was found that Census county boundaries were publicly provided from 2007-2023. To coincide with elections, we determined to focus on 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 data.
3. Our scope of data was narrowed a 3rd time after looking at the data and realizing the most complete and quality data across the board would be for the years 2012, 2016, and 2020.

# Alternate Considerations:
1. Dave’s DRA Git files [2010 & 2020 election (Harvard data) and Census Data] - https://github.com/dra2020/vtd_data/tree/master
2. Census Data: GeoID mapping to County
3. Presidential Precinct Map 2020 - https://github.com/TheUpshot/presidential-precinct-map-2020
4. GeoJSON Coordinates for the district maps:
   
   a. GeoJSON files across US - https://data-usdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/usdot::congressional-districts/explore?location=0.131172%2C0.314298%2C1.77&showTable=true
   
   b. Dave's DRA coordinates/web interface - https://medium.com/dra-2020/official-maps-90f43c695b4
   
   c. Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles – most accurate and complete for years needed
